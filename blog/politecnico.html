    <h2>Thoughts on POLIMI</h2>

      <p>Reading time: 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>These reflections are my takehome messages from spending three years at Politecnico. Eventually they are opinions, but each is very well-reasoned and well-informed.</p>
      <p><strong>1.</strong> Let&#39;s start with a biggie: <strong>the (divine) Mission of Politecnico is not to be Stanford</strong> and cuddle 10k students, <strong>but rather to prepare the best 15%+ of italian technicians each year</strong>. In numbers, that makes it a behemoth of 50k students from all kinds of socioeconomic backgrounds, with extremely low fees and high social accessibility.
      Now, it has taken me 2 year to realize that not aiming at the technical elite is what makes Politecnico special: no other university I&#39;ve ever seen does so much with so little resources, thanks to the <em>will of its staff to succeed</em>. Just to give you an idea of this university&#39;s standing, it has been able to consistently stay in the top20 of engineering schools worldwide (QS), it satisfies on its own the diverse needs of Lombardy&#39;s job market (one of the most productive regions in Europe), and covers all need-based scholarships (only 2 public universities in Italy managed that last year). On top of that, it did so with about 250M in public fundings. That is half comparable public institutions in Germany, one quarter or less in Switzerland.
      Many colleagues never realized their university&#39;s true objectives -- to form a whole territory rather than an elite -- and, while sad, that is solely on them. It would have sufficed to be humble and chat with the Professors actually managing Politecnico to get a clear idea of its aims. </p>
      <p><strong>2. Politecnico is too skewed towards theory: good.</strong>
      In fact, Politecnico engineers do not use common sense when they interact with the world, but rather frameworks. The big advantage of this is that it makes linking new heuristics, knowledge and practices very easy, scalable and long-term sustainable: an essential in a world of increasing complexity.
      Comparatively, the all-American hands-on approach I came to appreciate in NYC, does not teach the engineering mindset as much. And that, I reckon, is the true added value of university: if you simply want to be professionalized, there are technical institutes already; an engineer, on the other hand, needs to work at higher levels of complexity.
      This said, my perception is that Politecnico remains skewed towards theory in the Master&#39;s programme as well, and I believe that, at that point, this harms students more than helping them. Of course, as I am not taking my Master&#39;s there, this statement is weakly-supported.</p>
      <p><strong>3.1. Information engineers need to become domain-specialised, and ASAP.</strong> Mathematical Engineering and similar information-based courses, i.e. those with a methodological focus, have one of three outputs: practitioners with a mathematical focus, methodological focus (here the oxymoronic “Applied Mathematicians”), or domain-verticalisation. 
      In this regard, I am convinced of two things.
      First, a methodological background enables greater impact than any other perspective for domain-specialized technicians. See the revolution brought on by AlphaFold in drug discovery (and probably in medicine, as AL says). Somehow, a methodological background is much more flexible compared to dogma, usually innovates the most and thus brings impact. 
      Secondly, success in theoretical research or methodological specialisation (essentially, tech) are inherently more difficult and less predictable processes, and ultimately bring less real-world impact (both as first, and second order consequences).
      My personal tale is that after years spent in a methodological academic environment, I realized impact was my main <em>decision driver</em>, and therefore I decided to get domain-verticalized. This was especially thanks to chats had with the great GC and EZ. <strong>Taking a serious interests and chatting with people I esteemed has always been, without exceptions, a great investment.</strong>
      Now, I&#39;m getting started on my Master&#39;s Degree with great curiosity about Computational Biology, Robotics, and Hardware Design, but a serious specialization has yet to come: my next challenge will be to identify the path I want to stick with.</p>
      <p><strong>3.2. In this regard, the Polytechnic is to blame:</strong> my time there was packed with extracurricular activities, multidisciplinary groups, and 5 months at NYU. I freely admit that Politecnico&#39;s academic offer alone would not have allowed me to make informed decisions, and perhaps in support of this many of my colleagues ended up in the fields of pure mathematics or methodology: in short, the bottom line is <strong>lack of exposure ultimately implies lack of interest</strong>. 
      For the University, the only serious way to address this problem is to make compulsory (or at least possible, but in a structured way) to take projects strictly applied to <em>other</em> engineerings. To the best of my knowledge, the Computer Eng. and Automation Eng. suffer of the same problem, as almost all courses by Scuola 3I do to a lesser extent.</p>
      <p>And now that we are done with the Politecnico&#39;s stuff, what follows are some life lessons that have been enabled by my experiences at the school. I&#39;ve found these three to be the most impactful on long-term resilience and sustainability, and I&#39;d rather report them in Italian.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Non deludere mai nessuno:</strong> meglio abbassare le aspettative e poi batterle, che alzarle (magari per boostare l&#39;umore) e poi non raggiungerle. Imparato alzando le aspettative.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Coltivare amicizie, non <em>connections</em>.</strong> Una lezione in cui forse ho fallito più di tutti, e che ora tengo molto vicina a cuore e mente. Essere genuinamente interessati alle persone è la migliore maniera di renderle genuinamente interessante a te.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Imparare a conoscersi,</strong> o più nello specifico capire quale livello di benessere permette di performare al meglio è essenziale. Un po&#39; come lo sport per la salute fisica, nella mia esperienza la tranquillità e il benessere sono una medicina per la produttività che se potesse essere venduta sarebbe inestimabile. Naturalmente, l&#39;ho imparato ignorando completamente tutti i miei limiti per un anno (e pagandone il prezzo).</p>
      <p>In conclusione, il Politecnico, come il Volta prima di lui, ha vinto un angolino del mio cuore. Le persone che lo compongono (studenti, ma anche professori e personale) meritano tutta la mia considerazione: quando fallivo mi hanno dato un&#39;altra possibilità, quando non riuscito a reggere il peso mi hanno lasciato spazio, e buona parte di quel che so (sull&#39;ingegneria tanto quanto sulla vita) mi è stato insegnato lì. Se dovessi diventare Professore, il Politecnico è l&#39;unico posto dove vorrei davvero esserlo (e di università estere ne conosco bene parecchie).</p>
